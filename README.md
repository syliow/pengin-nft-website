Pengin Club is my first personal NFT (Non-Fungible Token) collection. I'm really interested in Ethereum and blockchain technology. So I decided to create a Pengin NFT collection and Pengin Club website as my portfolio.

>I'm not the only one with this idea! There are many other developers and designers who are creating websites, projects, and even businesses on the Ethereum blockchain. It's amazing to see what people are creating with this new technology!

## What is Pengin Club NFT? 
- Pengin Club is a collection of 3,333 Penguin NFTs‚Äîunique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain.
- Each Pengin is represented by an ERC-721 token on the Ethereum blockchain, making them unique and impossible to replicate. You can own, trade, and interact with your Pengins any way you choose.
- Pengin Club is the perfect place to start your NFT collection. With a wide variety of penguins available, you're sure to find the perfect one for you.

## Why NFT? 
- NFT stands for non-fungible token. This means that every individual token is unique, just like real-world collectibles. They can be used to represent anything from digital artwork, to game assets, to real-world collectibles like baseball cards or stamps and I think its something unique and innovative.

## How did I come up with the idea for Pengin Club? 
- I was working on my personal project which is a [Crypto Price Tracking Website](https://github.com/syliow/coinpengin-frontend) and there weren't any good idea options for my next personal project. 
- So I started brainstorming ways to make my portfolio projects interesting. That's when I came up with the idea for digital collectibles. I thought it would be cool to have a collection of digital penguins that lived on the blockchain.
